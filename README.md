# DBA3702_project
Project done for module Descriptive Analytics with R
<br> This app is made for people who are searching for condominiums to rent in Singapore, as well as condominium homeowners who are intending to rent out their units. We want potential tenants to be more aware of various amenities surrounding properties in Singapore, and potential landlords to recognise how their own proximity to amenities compares to that of other nearby properties.
<br> As a start, this app includes data on nearby shopping malls, schools, MRT/LRT stations, and hospitals, which are features we felt tenants would be most interested in. It also includes construction data, for tenants to know any potential noise disturbances around properties.
<br> This app is also developed with popular rental portal 99.co in mind. As such, the app checks for existing listings for selected properties for users in real-time as well!
<h4> <b>For tenants</b> </h4>
Just select any property and the period you would be staying there! This can be done via the drop-down menu or clicking on any property on the map.
<br> Depending on which layers you select, you will be able to see the nearest preschool, school, hospital, shopping mall, and MRT/LRT station, along with any construction happening within a 500m radius during your tenancy period.
<br> If there are any available listings for the property on 99.co, you will also be able to check them out!
<h4> <b>For owners</b> </h4>
Just select your property, either from the drop-down menu or clicking it on the map!
<br> You will be able to see the distances to the nearest preschool, school, hospital, shopping mall, and MRT/LRT station. Our research shows that is the maximum walking distance comfortable to most Singaporeans is 1km, so you will also be able to see how your property compares to that - as well as how your property fares alongside properties in the same district.
<br> If there are any available listings for the property on 99.co, you will also be able to see them, as a reference for your own listings!
